package client;
/*
All classes used by the client are in here. This package separates code for the client and the server.

Same as in server/package-info.java: I am considering
adding a "common" package for classes used by the server and client but I don't know how to let IntelliJ export that
so I'm not doing it right now. It is also not very urgent as it doesn't matter during development.
