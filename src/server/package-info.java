package server;
/*
The server classes are in this package, but the Server also needs the two data-storage classes Message and
ConnectedInfo.

Same as in client/package-info.java: I am considering
adding a "common" package for classes used by the server and client but I don't know how to let IntelliJ export that
so I'm not doing it right now. It is also not very urgent as it doesn't matter during development.
